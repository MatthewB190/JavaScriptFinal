	<h2>Characters</h2>
Now Super Smash Bros has a ton of characters, inculding DLC, there is 50+ characters from the games, Mario, Sonic, Metriod, Star Fox, Pokèmon and a bunch more. Some DLC characters include Ryu from
Street fighter and Cloud from final fantasy. You got characters from Mario like Mario, Luigi Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong and some new comers Rosalina and Bower Jr. Then Some Pokemon, Pikachu, Charizard
Lucario, a newcomer Greninja and DLC Mewtwo. You got solo characters from their games, Sonic, Mega Man Wii Fit Trainer, Olimar, and Nintendos R.O.B. So just reading this you can see there is a huge roster and
there is still a ton of characters like pac man and various games like fire emblem. Now if you have played the other games like Super Smash Bros Brawl and not Super Smash Bros 4 yet there is a lot of
different characters and some characters have been buffed and nerfed, except Ganondorf, he will always suck. So most likely there is going to be a character for you. And if you are on the
competitive side read the tier list section or click the link to look at the best characters.

<h3>Controls and Moves</h3>
So The controls are basicly the same with the wii u and 3ds versions. A button for regular attack. B for speacial attacls. Up on the joystick(Wii U) or circle pad(3DS) will make you jump.
R button or the right trigger on the 3DS or Wii U will shield you but be carful if the shield breaks it will stun you. and L button or trigger will grab your opponent. Now with the Smash Ball,
You have to hit it. Once you hit it a few times, it will break and surround you in aura. Press B to unleash your Final Smash. Now you depending on your character you can be a certian range away from
your opponent. So hit up training to learn about your character more, and just to train.

<h4>Tiers</h4>
So Tiers are for competitive players. They tell you how good your character is overall. S tier is the best and F is the worst. Now in no means do you have to pick the best character. Pick the one with
the play style that suits you. Now if you want to test some characters hop into training and check out those top tier characters and see how you like them. Now if you look up Super Smash Bros 4 tier lists.
You will find different ones than the one linked at the top of the page and thats because they are all different. I researched and this one looked the most balenced and is the one I agreed with most. So go fourth Smash 4 players.
If you have read all four sections than leap into the world of smash, and go Smash some noobs.
